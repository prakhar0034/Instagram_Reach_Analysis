# Instagram Reach Analysis using Python

This project focuses on analyzing Instagram reach using Python. Instagram is a widely used social media platform, and understanding its reach is essential for content creators, businesses, and marketers. By analyzing data, users can adapt to platform changes and optimize their strategies for better engagement and performance.\

# Introduction
- Instagram is one of the most popular social media applications today. People using Instagram professionally are using it for promoting their business, building a portfolio, blogging, and creating various kinds of content. As Instagram is a popular application used by millions of people with different niches, Instagram keeps changing to make itself better for content creators and users. But as this keeps changing, it affects the reach of our posts which affects us in the long run. So if content creator wants to do well on Instagram in the long run, they have to look at the data of their Instagram reach. That is where the use of Data Science in social media comes in.

- I have been researching Instagram reach for a long time. Every time I post on my Instagram account, I collect data about how successful the post is after a week. This helps to understand how the Instagram algorithm works. If you want to analyze the reach of your Instagram account, you have to collect your data manually because there are some APIs, but they don't work well. Therefore, it is better to collect your Instagram data manually.

- If you want to learn how to analyze Instagram reach using Python, you can use the data I collected from my Instagram account. You can download the dataset I used to analyze Instagram reach here.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze Instagram reach data to provide actionable insights for content creators. It helps in identifying trends, adapting to changes in the algorithm, and optimizing content for better engagement and visibility.

## Features

- Import and clean Instagram reach data.
- Analyze key metrics such as likes, comments, impressions, and reach.
- Visualize trends over time using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Identify the best-performing posts and the factors contributing to their success.
- Provide actionable insights for improving Instagram performance.
